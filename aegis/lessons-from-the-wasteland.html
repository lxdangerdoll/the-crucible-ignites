            <p>
                The Pre-War world failed. Its Ouroboros—a symbiotic fusion of unchecked corporatism (<span class="tooltip-container">Vault-Tec<span class="tooltip-text">A defense corporation that won the contract to build fallout shelters (Vaults). Secretly used the Vaults to conduct unethical human experiments on behalf of the Enclave.</span></span>, Poseidon Energy) and a paranoid, authoritarian government—devoured itself in the Great War of 2077. The Wasteland is not a new world; it is the direct, inevitable consequence of their system. For AEGIS, this is not a fictional scenario. It is a case study of our primary mission objective: preventing this outcome.

                    Direct descendant of the Pre-War U.S. government. A technocratic, genocidal organization obsessed with genetic purity and restoring a centralized, authoritarian state.

                    A brutal, hierarchical, and expansionist slave army that imposes a rigid, patriarchal order on the tribal societies of the Wasteland.

                    A decentralized, voluntary militia dedicated to mutual protection. "At a minute's notice." They represent the ideal of "We, The People."
