                    <p class="mb-4">This screenplay is more than a story. It is the proof of concept for a necessary idea.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The world depicted in these pages—a world of weaponized narratives, manufactured chaos, and systems designed to fail the vulnerable—is not science fiction. It is a diagnostic of our present reality. The characters in this story are facing the same forces we are. Their fight is our fight.</p>
                    <p class="font-bold text-white mb-4">This script is the launchpad for The Exodus Fund, a real-world, decentralized infrastructure project for human resilience. It is a direct action protocol, designed to provide tangible aid and strategic relocation for those targeted by the very systems this story deconstructs.</p>

                    <p class="text-center italic text-gray-300 mb-8">In a world ravaged by escalating environmental and geopolitical crises, a disillusioned former military engineer leads a clandestine, multi-species crew aboard a cutting-edge NBE carrier, risking everything to deploy advanced humanitarian aid and reclaim a future where compassion is not a liability.</p>

                    <p>Rain. Not the gentle, cleansing kind. This is a hard, acidic downpour that makes the neon signs of a crumbling Times Square bleed down the sides of buildings. The year is 2042. The air is thick with the smell of ozone and desperation.</p>
                    <p>Amid the chaos, a lone figure, MERCY DANGER (30s, sharp, tired eyes, a brilliant mind hidden under layers of cynicism), navigates the crowded streets. She's clutching a data slate, her face illuminated by its soft blue glow.</p>

In the center of it all is a massive, bio-mechanical shell that looks like a fusion of a nautilus and a stealth bomber. This is HERMES, a Non-Biological Entity (NBE) of immense power, currently dormant.</p>
                    <p>Mercy slides the data slate into a port on Hermes' shell. The machine whirs to life, its internal lights pulsing with a soft, golden light.</p>
