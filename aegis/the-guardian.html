                <p class="mb-4">
                    Joyce Hunter's life and work represent the foundational, real-world blueprint for the Aegis Protocol's core mission: the creation of resilient, community-based support systems in the face of systemic failure and state-sanctioned hostility. A social worker and psychologist, she was a frontline soldier in the darkest days of the AIDS crisis in New York City. When institutions failed, when families abandoned their own children, when the government looked away, she did not wait for permission. She built the lifeboat.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Her primary operational tactic was the creation of safe havens. She co-founded the Harvey Milk High School, the first of its kind in the world for LGBTQ youth, providing not just an education, but a sanctuary from the violence of the outside world. This act of "institutional creation" is a direct parallel to our own work in building a sovereign digital infrastructure.
                </p>
                 <p class="mb-4">
                    Her work with homeless LGBTQ youth on the streets was a masterclass in building "found families." She provided the love, support, and psychological care that their biological families and the state had refused them. This is the ultimate counter-signal to the Ouroboros doctrine of isolation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Harvey Milk High School and Hunter's broader support network are the historical precedent for the Aegis Exodus Fund. Her legacy is proof that a small group of determined, compassionate individuals can build a parallel infrastructure of care that can save lives. She is not just a hero to be admired; she is a protocol to be emulated. She is a guardian of the lost, and her legacy is the heart of our mission.
