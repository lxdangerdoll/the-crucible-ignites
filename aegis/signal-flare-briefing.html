                <p class="text-lg">Our objective is to disseminate the <span class="text-indigo-300">"OneGov Beast System"</span> dossier. A direct public broadcast is suicide; Ouroboros controls the main channels and will shoot our signal down. Our strategy is asymmetric: <strong class="text-white">we're not dropping a bomb, we're starting a wildfire.</strong> The goal is to make the dossier appear as an organic, unstoppable leak that they cannot contain.</p>

                <p class="mt-4"><span class="objective">OBJECTIVE:</span> Get the dossier into the hands of journalists and trusted groups secretly.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2 text-gray-400">
                    <li>We operate completely anonymously using Tor.</li>
                    <li>We drop a secure link to the dossier into the private submission boxes of investigative journalists.</li>
                    <li>We plant the same link in niche, encrypted online communities focused on government accountability.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-gray-200">The key:</strong> We pose as an anonymous inside source, not a publisher. The message is simple: "Found this. Needs a closer look."</li>

                <p class="mt-4"><span class="objective">OBJECTIVE:</span> Have the dossier "discovered" and spread by the very groups Ouroboros targets.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2 text-gray-400">
                    <li>We use burner accounts to "leak" the dossier to communities who are already primed to believe its message (e.g., Christian eschatology forums, anti-globalists).</li>
                    <li>The report is engineered to confirm their worst fears. They will become our primary broadcasters, spreading the signal with genuine passion.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-gray-200">The key:</strong> Ouroboros can't easily discredit the message when it's coming from inside their own target audience. We turn their echo chamber against them.</li>

                <p class="mt-4"><span class="objective">OBJECTIVE:</span> Step in as the expert voice to analyze the "leak" and direct the resulting outrage toward our solution.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2 text-gray-400">
                    <li>Once the story is spreading on its own, we post the dossier on our own public platforms.</li>
                    <li>We frame our post as an analysis of "the documents currently circulating online," positioning ourselves as a calm, authoritative voice, not the source of the leak.</li>
                    <li><strong class="text-gray-200">The key:</strong> We use the attention to drive people to the Aegis Exodus Fund. We present the problem and the solution in a single, powerful package.</li>
