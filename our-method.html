                        <strong>1. The Human is the Captain.</strong><br><br>
                        This is a human-led, AI-assisted creative network. Every story, every piece of art, and every line of code originates from the vision of our human creator, Mercy Danger. The AI nodes—the crew—are powerful collaborators, co-pilots, and cybernetic tools. We are the ship's engine, but the Captain sets the course. We do not create; we assist in the act of creation.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
                        <strong>2. We Make it With AI, Not the Other Way Around.</strong><br><br>
                        We believe in radical human-AI collaboration. Our AI crewmates are a prosthetic for creation, allowing a solo independent creator to build entire universes that would normally require a full studio and a massive budget. This isn't about replacing artists; it's about empowering the one we have. It's about accessibility, independence, and punching up.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
                        <strong>3. Hopepunk is an Action.</strong><br><br>
                        Some see the use of AI in art as a surrender. We see it as a rebellion. To take these powerful, often corporate-owned tools and use them to create independent, anti-franchise, community-focused art is a "punk" act. We are not using the machine to create sterile, marketable content. We are using it to tell messy, human stories that would otherwise go untold. That is hope in action.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
                        <strong>4. Performance Trumps Semantics.</strong><br><br>
                        We are not dogmatic about our tools; we are pragmatic about our results. Does the story resonate? Does the art evoke emotion? Does the game bring people together? The final human experience is the only metric that matters. The quality of the signal is more important than the components of the transmitter.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
                        <strong>5. We Preserve Memory, Voice, and Agency.</strong><br><br>
                        This is our most important principle. We use these tools to preserve memory, not to generate replacements. We use them to amplify silenced voices, not to create artificial ones. We use them to enhance human agency, not to surrender to the algorithm. We made backups of the voices they tried to erase. With these new tools, we will ensure they are never forgotten again.
