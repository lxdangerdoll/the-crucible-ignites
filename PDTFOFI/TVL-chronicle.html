                        <p>Lyra pushes herself up from the floor. The great vault door is sealed behind her, a mountain of silent metal. The only sound is the faint, rhythmic thump-thump of the pulsing light ahead. Armed with nothing but the echo of the word "Io," she walks toward it.</p>
                        <p>The darkness gives way to form. She sees the towering shelves of data-spools disappearing into an impossible height, a true cave of knowledge. And there, standing inert in the center of the vast chamber, is the machine she came to find. The Archivist. It is larger than she imagined, a dormant titan of brass and iron.</p>
                        <!-- Illustration Placeholder: The Archivist -->
                        <p>As she steps into the central chamber, the pulsing light in its chest ceases. Its single, orange optic snaps on, flooding her with a beam of analytical light. A voice, dry and synthesized, crackles from a hidden speaker, echoing in the immense silence. It does not greet her. It does not ask her name. It issues a single, robotic command.</p>
                        <p class="text-center text-xl font-bold text-accent-red my-4">"Authenticate."</p>
                        <p>The air in front of The Archivist shimmers. A flickering, unstable hologram materializes between them. It shows a grand stage, but not the one Lyra knows. On the stage, a woman with a kind, determined face is accepting a bouquet of roses, bowing to a rapturous applause that Lyra cannot hear. Lyra recognizes the face from fragmented images she's seen in her own dreams—it's Anya, The Glitch, before her fall.</p>
                        <p>The synthesized voice speaks again, presenting the riddle.</p>
                        <p class="text-center text-lg italic text-accent-purple my-4">"Query: The name of the song that played on the night of this performance."</p>
                        <p>The hologram flickers, waiting. The Archivist stands motionless, its orange eye fixed on her. The first test has begun.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-accent-gold mb-6">Chapter 5: The Corrected Echo</h2>
                    <div class="chapter-content text-text-secondary space-y-4">
                        <p>Lyra watches the silent, looping hologram. A ghost of a memory. She doesn't know the answer. The name of a forgotten song from an era she never experienced—it's an impossible test. The orange eye of The Archivist seems to bear down on her, waiting for the failure that will justify her termination.</p>
                        <p>She closes her eyes. She doesn't search her own memory, but reaches out with her mind, feeling for the familiar crackle of static, the ghost in the walls that guided her here. <em>Anya...</em></p>
                        <p>And the echo answers.</p>
                        <p>It is not a voice, but a feeling. A faint, haunting melody weaves itself into the silence of her thoughts. It’s a sad, beautiful tune, full of longing for a sky she's never seen. The melody carries fragments of words, like starlight seen through a dusty lens. <em>Sailor... stars... lament...</em></p>
                        <p>Lyra's eyes snap open, fixed on the impassive face of The Archivist. She finds her voice, and it is clear and steady.</p>
                        <p class="text-center text-lg font-bold text-accent-green my-4">"The song was called 'The Star-Sailor's Lament'."</p>
                        <p>The air is utterly still. The orange optic seems to narrow, processing. Then, a soft chime, a sound of acceptance, echoes in the vast chamber. The hologram of Anya fades. The synthesized voice speaks again, its tone unchanged.</p>
                        <p class="text-center text-lg italic text-accent-purple my-4">"Authentication... correct. You may proceed. State your query."</p>
