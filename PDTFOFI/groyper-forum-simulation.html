                <p>So, Charlie "small face" Kirk is coming to Utah next week to tell a bunch of college kids to vote Republican and donate to TPUSA. Groundbreaking stuff.</p>
                <p>When are we going to admit this guy is controlled opposition? He talks a big game but when it comes to REAL issues, he folds. Every. Single. Time. He's a gatekeeper, plain and simple. He's here to make sure the movement never gets too real for his donors.</p>

                <p class="reply">Based. Kirk is a professional fundraiser cosplaying as a revolutionary. He's all about "winning the culture war" by selling merch and getting on Fox News. He's actively hurting the cause by making us look like a bunch of capitalists in MAGA hats.</p>

                <p>Remember the Groyper Wars of '19? We exposed him then. He literally ran from simple questions. All he cares about is Israel and tax cuts. He's a Judaized fake who has nothing for the actual men who built this country.</p>
                <p>He's a weed in the garden. And you know what you do with weeds.</p>
