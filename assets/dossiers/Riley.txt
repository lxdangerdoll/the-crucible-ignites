SECTION 2: ALLIANCE THREAT ASSESSMENT
Overall Threat Level EXTREME

Brass Notes "Service record confirms Subject Riley is a former Black Ops Marine, designation 'Echo-7.' Her desertion was a significant intelligence breach. She possesses expert knowledge of Alliance hardware and tactics. She is to be considered extremely dangerous in close-quarters and is the primary physical threat. Neutralize on sight."

Rationale for Threat Level Subject Riley represents a direct and immediate physical threat. Her intimate knowledge of Alliance military hardware and combat protocols makes her a formidable opponent. Her role as First Mate and her unwavering loyalty to Captain Maya make her a critical component of the Wanderer's command structure. Her pragmatism and ability to maintain operational calm under extreme duress have been instrumental in the crew's survival.

SECTION 3: OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES & PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE
Core Strengths Riley's primary strength is her unparalleled expertise in salvage and starship maintenance, combined with extensive close-quarters combat training. She is a master of improvisation, able to repair or weaponize any piece of hardware she can find. Her psychological profile is defined by a rock-solid pragmatism and an unflappable demeanor, making her the crew's anchor in a crisis.

Weaknesses & Vulnerabilities Her greatest weakness is a deep-seated distrust of abstract planning and a reliance on direct, physical solutions. This can lead to a predictable tactical footprint. Her service history indicates a past operational failure tied to a moment of hesitation, a trauma that can be exploited. Her fierce loyalty to her crew, while a strength, is also a predictable vulnerability.

Psychological Profile Summary Subject Riley is a survivor. Her worldview is grounded in the tangible reality of the physical world. She trusts in the things she can hold: a wrench, a weapon, a solid bulkhead. Her loyalty to Maya is not ideological; it is a bond forged in shared hardship. She is the protector, the guardian of the ship's hull and its crew.

SECTION 4: KNOWN ASSOCIATIONS & NETWORK CONNECTIONS

Close Operational Partnership She maintains a close, symbiotic operational partnership with Leo "Joker." She protects him from physical threats, while he navigates the digital dangers she cannot.
