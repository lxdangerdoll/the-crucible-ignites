SFS INTELLIGENCE REPORT - CLASSIFIED (ANNOTATED)
FILE NUMBER: SFS-WANDERER-ALPHA-009-VESSEL DATE: 2491.08.30 SUBJECT: Vessel Profile: S.F.S. Wanderer (Designation: "The Spark") ISSUING AUTHORITY: Synapse Field Systems - Strategic Analysis Division

CLASSIFICATION: RED (High Priority Target; Capture Intact if Possible)

SECTION 1: VESSEL PROFILE
Official Designation S.F.S. Wanderer

Crew Callsign "The Spark"

Class Heavily Modified Survey-class Freighter (Pre-Unification Era)

Hull ID REDACTED - Transponder signal is frequently altered, making positive identification via standard tracking impossible.

Current Captain Operator 01: Maya

SECTION 2: ALLIANCE THREAT ASSESSMENT
Overall Threat Level HIGH

Brass Notes "This vessel should have been decommissioned and scrapped a century ago. Its continued operation is a direct violation of Alliance fleet standardization protocols. The ship's ability to evade modern sensor nets is statistically impossible for a vessel of its class, suggesting a level of non-standard modification that represents a significant technological threat. The crew's unusual attachment to the vessel, referring to it by a callsign, should be noted as a potential psychological vulnerability."

Rationale for Threat Level The S.F.S. Wanderer is a ghost. It is a relic that not only continues to function but operates with an efficiency and unpredictability that rivals modern scout ships. It is a symbol of pre-Alliance independence and a tangible piece of "forbidden" technology. Its continued existence is a direct affront to the narrative of Alliance technological superiority.

SECTION 3: OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES
Propulsion Equipped with a non-standard, pre-Unification Fold Drive. The drive's energy signature is unlike any in the current Alliance database, making its FTL jumps difficult to track or predict. It appears to be maintained and modified by Operator 04: Lyra Solara.

Power Core The ship's original fusion core has been heavily modified. It emits a unique, almost biological energy signature that is believed to be directly entangled with the "Spark" entity. This symbiotic power system seems to allow for incredible resilience and efficiency, running on low-grade fuel and salvaged parts.

Stealth & Evasion While possessing no formal cloaking technology, the Wanderer is notoriously difficult to track. Operator 03: Leo has demonstrated the ability to constantly rewrite the ship's transponder codes. The vessel is also surprisingly maneuverable for its class, suggesting significant thruster and inertial dampener upgrades.

Defenses Standard kinetic plating has been reinforced with salvaged, non-standard alloys. The ship is not built for direct combat, but has demonstrated the use of unpredictable, jury-rigged countermeasures, including targeted EMP bursts and environmental exploitation.

SECTION 4: SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP
The vessel's most significant and dangerous feature is its symbiotic relationship with the crew, particularly with the engineer, Lyra Solara, and the "Spark" entity. The crew does not treat the Wanderer as a machine, but as a living member of their unit. This allows for an unprecedented level of intuitive control and repair. The ship's nickname, "The Spark," is a direct acknowledgment of this fusion. For all operational purposes, the ship and the entity are one and the same.

SECTION 5: CONNECTION TO UNIVERSE LORE
As a pre-Unification vessel, the Wanderer is a living piece of history from a time of greater independence and exploration. It is a symbol of the very ideals the Alliance sought to crush in the Unification War. In the hands of this crew, it has become a mobile beacon for the "Sanctuary" movement, a ghost ship carrying a promise of a different, freer way of life.

SECTION 6: ANTHEM & CORE IDENTIFIER
Anthem "The Chain" - Fleetwood Mac

Motto "Held together by rust, hope, and a little bit of magic."
