---

## SECTION 1: OPERATOR PROFILE - MAYA
- **Callsign:** "Captain" (Self-designated/Crew-designated; not official Alliance rank)
- **True Name:** Maya (Last name unconfirmed, suspected to be a deliberately obscured Rim-World designation)
- **Age:** Approximately 29-32 Earth Standard Cycles
- **Species:** Human (Terran-descendant, Rim-World lineage)
- **Role:** Leader, Systems Architect, Moral Compass of the S.F.S. Wanderer crew.

### Physical Description
- **Height:** 1.70m
- **Build:** Lean, athletic, indicative of extensive physical training and hardship.
- **Hair:** Dark brown, often worn tied back for practicality, with stray strands frequently escaping.
- **Eyes:** Hazel, sharp and perceptive, betraying a deep weariness beneath a fierce determination. Often described as "seeing beyond the immediate."
- **Distinguishing Marks:** Prominent scar across left eyebrow. Cybernetic Left Leg: (See Section 3.2 - Proprietary Enhancements). Fully integrated, with visible, custom plating and articulation. Appears well-maintained by Lyra Solara.
- **Attire:** Favors practical, worn black utility uniform augmented by a distinctive, long, deep-red leather duster coat (believed to be pre-Unification antique, highly durable). Always observed with a large, heavy-duty steel wrench, often carried as an affectation but used with surprising dexterity.

## SECTION 2: ALLIANCE THREAT ASSESSMENT
- **Overall Threat Level:** EXTREME (Alpha-level designation)
- **Brass Notes:** "Do not be fooled by the 'scavenger' persona. Subject Maya is a highly effective asymmetrical strategist. Her greatest weakness—her attachment to her crew—is also the source of her unpredictable, and often successful, gambits. She does not think like a soldier; she thinks like a system architect, making her dangerously difficult to anticipate. Recommend psychological operations targeting crew cohesion."
- **Rationale for Threat Level:** Subject Maya has consistently demonstrated leadership and tactical prowess far exceeding her apparent training or resources. She exhibits an uncanny ability to turn seemingly insurmountable odds into tactical advantages, often leveraging her crew's unique (and highly dangerous) skill sets with remarkable precision. Her resistance to conventional Alliance tactics and her ideological commitment to "Sanctuary" principles make her a critical threat to Alliance stability in the Rim.

## SECTION 3: OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES & PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE
### 3.1 Core Strengths
- **Leadership:** Inspires fanatical loyalty in her crew. Able to synthesize disparate skill sets into a cohesive, highly effective unit. Leads by example, not by decree.
- **Strategic Thinking:** Possesses an intuitive grasp of complex systems, both mechanical and social. Capable of long-term planning, but highly adaptable to real-time tactical shifts.
- **Improvisation:** Exceptional at leveraging limited resources and unexpected events to her advantage. "Makes something out of nothing."
- **Moral Compass:** Maintains a strict, if sometimes flexible, ethical code. This provides a clear purpose for her crew and acts as a powerful psychological defense against Alliance manipulation.
- **Combat Prowess:** Highly skilled in close-quarters combat, both armed and unarmed. Utilizes her cybernetic leg for enhanced mobility and striking power. Displays proficiency with various small arms.

### 3.2 Weaknesses & Vulnerabilities
- **Crew Attachment:** Her most significant vulnerability. Her loyalty to her crew is absolute, and any threat to them will override other objectives. This is a primary target for psychological exploitation.
- **Self-Doubt:** Despite her strong exterior, internal analysis indicates periods of deep self-questioning regarding her decisions and leadership (potential for manipulation via self-incrimination).
- **Past Trauma:** Believed to be a veteran of the Unification War, fighting on the Rim-side. Specific traumatic events unknown, but likely inform her distrust of authority and her drive to build "Sanctuary." Her cybernetic leg is a physical manifestation of this trauma.

### 3.3 Proprietary Enhancements
- **Cybernetic Left Leg:** Classified as highly advanced, non-Alliance origin. Sustained damage during an unspecified conflict. Modified and maintained by Subject Lyra Solara. Enhancements are suspected to include:
  - Enhanced impact resistance.
  - Variable traction control.
  - Integrated sensory feedback (tactile/pressure).
  - (Unconfirmed) Short-range magnetic grappling/propulsion systems.
  - (Unconfirmed) Bio-luminescent accent lighting, for purely aesthetic purposes (highly irregular for tactical equipment).

### 3.4 Psychological Profile Summary
Subject Maya presents as a highly resilient and fiercely independent individual. Her core drive is to create a safe, self-sustaining community (the "Sanctuary") outside of Alliance control. Her leadership is rooted in earned trust rather than imposed authority. She views her crew not as subordinates but as essential components of a larger, living system. Her greatest internal conflict stems from the weight of responsibility for these individuals and the constant fear of failing them.

## SECTION 4: KNOWN ASSOCIATIONS & NETWORK CONNECTIONS
- **Primary Command Node:** The undisputed leader of the S.F.S. Wanderer crew.
- **Close Operational Partners:** Riley "Rock" (First Mate/Tactical), Leo "Joker" (Helmsman/Cyber Ops), Lyra "Spark" (Chief Engineer/Symbiotic Interface).
- **Strategic Alliance:** Believed to maintain a delicate balance with all other crew members, leveraging their unique capabilities for collective survival.
- **Relationship to "Spark" Entity:** Exhibits a deep, almost familial, trust in Lyra and the emergent "Spark" entity, relying on its intuitive guidance.

---

## SECTION 5: CONNECTION TO UNIVERSE LORE
- **Unification War Veteran:** Confirmed Rim-side combatant. Her history directly links her to the anti-Alliance resistance movement.
- **"Sanctuary" Narrative:** Believed to be a central figure in the emergent "Sanctuary" narrative, actively seeking and protecting those who reject Alliance "Optimal Contentment." Her vessel, the Wanderer, is considered a mobile beacon for this movement.
- **Anti-Alliance Symbolism:** Her very existence and continued operation represent a direct challenge to Alliance authority and its claim of universal hegemony.

---

## SECTION 6: ANTHEM & CORE IDENTIFIER
- **Anthem:** "The Passenger" - Iggy Pop (Analysis: Reflects a desire for freedom, movement, and observation outside of established control. Suggests a focus on experience over destination.)
- **Memorable Quote:** "Don't tell me what you need; tell me what you have." (Analysis: Emphasizes resourcefulness, pragmatic problem-solving, and a rejection of dependence on external aid.)
