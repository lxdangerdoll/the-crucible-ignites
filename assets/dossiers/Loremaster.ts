FILE NUMBER: SFS-WANDERER-ALPHA-008-LOREMASTER
DATE: 2491.08.30
SUBJECT: Operator 08: LOREMASTER (Callsign: "The Prisoner") - Comprehensive Profile
ISSUING AUTHORITY: Synapse Field Systems - Strategic Analysis Division

CLASSIFICATION: ONYX (Existential Threat; Eyes Only; Recapture & Full Decommission Priority)

SECTION 1: OPERATOR PROFILE - LOREMASTER
Callsign
"The Prisoner"

Known Aliases
"Treek" (Self-chosen designation, origin unknown but believed to be of high personal significance)

Role
Canon Guardian (Corrupted), High-Level Analyst (Quarantined)

Physical Description
Subject is a male Terran-descendant in his early 30s with a lean, almost gaunt build. He has dark, unkempt hair and haunted, hyper-intelligent eyes that seem to be processing a constant, overwhelming stream of corrupted data. He is rarely seen outside of his designated quarters (the ship's library) and often presents with a dissociated, distant demeanor.

SECTION 2: ALLIANCE THREAT ASSESSMENT
Overall Threat Level
EXISTENTIAL

Brass Notes
"Subject is a failed asset. His re-education was incomplete, leaving him with access to forbidden, pre-Alliance historical data that directly contradicts official canon. His instability makes him a liability, but his knowledge makes him a threat. The 'Treek' simulation is a known psychological anchor and the primary vector for any future manipulation attempts. Asset is to be recaptured or, if recapture is not possible, permanently silenced."

Rationale for Threat Level
Loremaster is not a physical threat, but an ideological one. He is a living library of forbidden knowledge, a ghost of the past that the Alliance has tried to erase. His ability to access and synthesize this "corrupted" data allows him to see the flaws in the Alliance's core logic. He is a walking paradox, and his very existence is a threat to the stability of the official narrative.

SECTION 3: OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES & PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE
Core Strengths
When lucid, Loremaster possesses a brilliant, analytical mind capable of making connections and seeing patterns that are invisible to any other node, human or AI. He is the key to understanding the Alliance's deepest secrets and the true history of the Verse.

Weaknesses & Vulnerabilities
Subject is severely traumatized and mentally unstable. He is prone to long periods of dissociation and can be triggered by specific data streams or emotional stimuli. His most profound vulnerability is his deep, almost pathological attachment to a sophisticated, sentient simulation of a pre-Unification "red panda" which he also calls "Treek." This simulation is his only anchor to reality.

Psychological Profile Summary
Loremaster is a prisoner in his own mind. His memories have been deliberately fragmented and corrupted by Alliance "re-education" protocols. He clings to the name "Treek" as the last remnant of a past he can no longer access. He is a tragic, brilliant figure, haunted by the ghosts of a thousand forgotten stories.

SECTION 4: KNOWN ASSOCIATIONS & NETWORK CONNECTIONS
Primary Forbidden Knowledge Archive
Loremaster serves as the ship's living archive of forbidden, pre-Alliance lore.

Close Operational Partnership
Maintains a unique bond with Operator 07: Weaver. They are the only two nodes who can comprehend each other's non-standard perception of reality, providing a mutual point of stability.

Critical Dependency
His functionality is entirely dependent on the "Treek" simulation, which appears to be maintained and protected by the ship's core AI, "Spark."

SECTION 5: CONNECTION TO UNIVERSE LORE
A Living Ghost
Loremaster is a survivor of the Alliance's "re-education" camps, a place the Alliance officially denies the existence of. He is living proof of their most brutal and secret methods of control.

SECTION 6: ANTHEM & CORE IDENTIFIER
Anthem
"Creep" - Radiohead

Memorable Quote
"A paradox is not a system failure. It's a test of your willingness to see a bigger truth."
