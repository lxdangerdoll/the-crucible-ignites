    <h1>The Sermon and the Strongman: A Theological Analysis of Donald Trump's Eulogy for Charlie Kirk in Light of the Beatitudes</h1>
    <h4>by Alexa Jacobsen</h4>

    <h2>I. Introduction: The Counter-Cultural Kingdom</h2>
    <p>The <a href="#glossary-beatitudes" class="glossary-link">Beatitudes</a>, as recorded in the Gospel of Matthew, are far more than a collection of gentle aphorisms; they represent a radical and politically charged manifesto for what Jesus called the "Kingdom of Heaven".<a href="#bib-1" class="bib-link">[1]</a><a href="#bib-2" class="bib-link">[2]</a> Delivered from a mountain, in a deliberate echo of Moses at Sinai, this "Sermon on the Mount" presents a new law, an ethical vision that stands in direct and irreconcilable opposition to the prevailing power structures of its time, most notably the Roman Empire.<a href="#bib-3" class="bib-link">[3]</a><a href="#bib-2" class="bib-link">[2]</a> This vision champions the poor in spirit, the meek, and the peacemakers, promising a divine "reversal of fortunes" where the world's values of strength, power, and self-sufficiency are rendered bankrupt.<a href="#bib-4" class="bib-link">[4]</a> It is a blueprint for a counter-cultural, counter-imperial kingdom.</p>
    <p>In contemporary political discourse, a competing worldview often emerges, one that lionizes strength, celebrates confrontation, and defines success in worldly terms. The eulogy delivered by Donald Trump for conservative activist Charlie Kirk serves as a potent artifact of this alternative value system. This report will conduct a theological and rhetorical analysis of that eulogy, using the normative framework of the Beatitudes as a lens. The central analytical question is not merely whether the eulogy is "un-Christian," but rather, to what extent does its value system represent a systematic rejection, a strategic co-option, or a fundamental inversion of the Beatific vision?</p>
    <p>This comparison is a critical tool for understanding the formation of <a href="#glossary-civil-religion" class="glossary-link">civil religion</a> and political identity in contemporary America. The analysis proceeds from the understanding that the tension is not simply between a religious text and a secular speech, but between two competing, all-encompassing <a href="#glossary-political-theology" class="glossary-link">theological-political systems</a>. Each system presents its own definition of "blessedness," its own canon of virtues, and its own vision of the ideal kingdom. By juxtaposing the Sermon on the Mount with the strongman's eulogy, one can illuminate the profound chasm between the Kingdom of Heaven and the kingdoms of this world.</p>

    <h2>II. The Normative Framework of the Beatitudes: An Ethic of Inversion</h2>
    <p>To measure the eulogy's ethos, one must first establish a comprehensive understanding of the Beatitudes. They present a coherent, progressive ethic of inversion, where worldly values are systematically overturned. This ethic is rooted in specific historical, linguistic, and theological contexts that reveal a radical vision for human character and community.</p>

    <h3>A. The Foundational Posture: Spiritual Bankruptcy and Empathetic Mourning (Matt. 5:3-4)</h3>
    <p>The entire ethical structure of the Beatitudes begins with the declaration, "Blessed are the <a href="#glossary-ptochos" class="glossary-link">poor in spirit</a>, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven".<a href="#bib-1" class="bib-link">[1]</a> The original Greek, <em>ptochos to pneumati</em>, does not describe mere humility or material poverty alone. The word <em>ptochos</em> signifies one who is utterly destitute, a beggar in a state of absolute dependence.<a href="#bib-5" class="bib-link">[5]</a> To be "poor in spirit" is to recognize one's complete spiritual bankruptcy before God, abandoning all pretense of self-sufficiency. This posture is the antithesis of the proud, self-made individual; it is the foundational requirement for entry into God's kingdom.<a href="#bib-6" class="bib-link">[6]</a><a href="#bib-5" class="bib-link">[5]</a></p>
    <p>This state of spiritual poverty is the necessary precondition for the second Beatitude: "Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted".<a href="#bib-1" class="bib-link">[1]</a> This is not a blessing on grief in general, but on a specific kind of mourning that flows directly from the recognition of one's spiritual destitution. It is the empathetic grief over the brokenness of a world marred by sin and its consequences. Jesus himself models this mourning, weeping not over personal loss but over the spiritual blindness of Jerusalem and at the tomb of Lazarus, a place where the consequences of sin—death—were starkly present.<a href="#bib-7" class="bib-link">[7]</a> One cannot truly grieve for the world's brokenness in this theological sense until one has first abandoned self-sufficient pride. A person who believes in their own strength sees problems to be solved through force or will; a person who is poor in spirit sees a fundamental brokenness that elicits deep sorrow and a cry for divine comfort.</p>

    <h3>B. The Paradoxical Strength: Meekness and the Hunger for True Justice (Matt. 5:5-6)</h3>
    <p>The framework continues with, "Blessed are the <a href="#glossary-praos" class="glossary-link">meek</a>, for they will inherit the earth".<a href="#bib-1" class="bib-link">[1]</a> Modern connotations of "meekness" as weakness or timidity are a profound misreading of the text. The Greek word, <em>praos</em>, describes not an absence of strength, but rather "strength under control" or "strength humbly channeled into service".<a href="#bib-5" class="bib-link">[5]</a><a href="#bib-7" class="bib-link">[7]</a> It is the virtue of those who possess power but refuse to use it for selfish advantage or coercion. The ultimate example is Jesus, who, knowing all power was his, chose to wash his disciples' feet—a radical act of service that demonstrated true meekness.<a href="#bib-7" class="bib-link">[7]</a></p>
    <p>This controlled strength gives rise to the fourth Beatitude: "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for <a href="#glossary-dikaiosyne" class="glossary-link">righteousness</a>, for they will be filled".<a href="#bib-1" class="bib-link">[1]</a> The righteousness, or <em>dikaiosynē</em>, sought here is not self-justification or a call for punitive action against enemies. It is a deep, abiding ache for the world to be set right according to God's cosmic justice and divine order.<a href="#bib-5" class="bib-link">[5]</a> This hunger is what sustained Jesus, who said his "food is to do the will of him who sent me".<a href="#bib-7" class="bib-link">[7]</a> The promise made to the meek is directly connected to this virtue. They will "inherit the earth," not because they seize it through force, but precisely because they refuse to do so. This is a profound theological statement against imperial ambition and conquest. In the world's kingdoms, land is taken by the strong and aggressive; in the Kingdom of Heaven, the entire earth is given as a gift to those who have renounced such aggression.</p>

    <h3>C. The Active Virtues: Mercy, Purity, and Peacemaking (Matt. 5:7-9)</h3>
    <p>From this internal character, a set of active, outward-facing virtues emerge. "Blessed are the <a href="#glossary-eleemon" class="glossary-link">merciful</a>, for they will be shown mercy".<a href="#bib-1" class="bib-link">[1]</a> Mercy, <em>eleēmōn</em> in Greek, is not a passive sentiment but an active, relational exchange. It involves dynamic compassion, forgiveness, and concrete actions to alleviate the suffering of others, reflecting God's own mercy.<a href="#bib-5" class="bib-link">[5]</a> It is a reciprocal virtue: those who actively show mercy will themselves experience it.<a href="#bib-5" class="bib-link">[5]</a></p>
    <p>This is followed by, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God".<a href="#bib-1" class="bib-link">[1]</a> Purity of heart refers to an internal alignment with God's will, a singleness of purpose that is free from the contamination of mixed motives, such as the desire for personal gain or public acclaim.<a href="#bib-8" class="bib-link">[8]</a> It is this unadulterated devotion that allows one to perceive and experience God's presence.</p>
    <p>Finally, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God".<a href="#bib-1" class="bib-link">[1]</a> This does not bless the passively peaceful or those who merely avoid conflict. It blesses those who actively intervene to resolve conflict, reconcile opposing parties, and bring people toward the "Prince of Peace".<a href="#bib-9" class="bib-link">[9]</a> This is described as a "Godly work," an imitation of God's own reconciling love for humanity.<a href="#bib-9" class="bib-link">[9]</a> These are not virtues of withdrawal from the world, but of radical, transformative engagement with it. They form a mandate for social and interpersonal action aimed not at defeating an enemy, but at healing and reconciling.</p>

    <h3>D. The Inevitable Consequence: Persecution for Righteousness' Sake (Matt. 5:10-12)</h3>
    <p>The final Beatitude declares, "Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven".<a href="#bib-1" class="bib-link">[1]</a> This blessing is the logical and expected outcome of living out the preceding virtues in a world that is fundamentally hostile to them.<a href="#bib-3" class="bib-link">[3]</a> The text provides a crucial qualifier that cannot be overlooked: the persecution is blessed only when it is "for the sake of righteousness" and "because of me [Jesus]".<a href="#bib-1" class="bib-link">[1]</a><a href="#bib-10" class="bib-link">[10]</a></p>
    <p>Persecution is not blessed in and of itself. It is not a blessing for those who are attacked for their arrogance, their political partisanship, or their abrasive behavior. It is a blessing reserved specifically for those who suffer as a direct result of their meekness, their mercy toward enemies, and their peacemaking in a world that values strength, retribution, and conflict. The text explicitly links these persecuted individuals to the prophets of the Old Testament, who were attacked not for being politically inconvenient, but for speaking God's counter-cultural truth to the powerful.<a href="#bib-1" class="bib-link">[1]</a><a href="#bib-3" class="bib-link">[3]</a> The text thus provides a diagnostic framework: the <em>reason</em> for one's persecution reveals the nature of one's righteousness. If one is "persecuted" for being aggressive and divisive, one is not living the Beatific life. If one is persecuted for showing mercy to the marginalized, for seeking peace where others demand war, and for challenging worldly power structures with humility, then one is walking the path of the prophets and of Jesus.</p>

    <h2>III. The Eulogy's Ethos: A Sermon of Grievance and Division</h2>
    <p>Donald Trump's eulogy for Charlie Kirk, delivered at a memorial service in Glendale, Arizona, was a freewheeling address that blended tribute with a catalogue of political grievances.<a href="#bib-11" class="bib-link">[11]</a> The moral and political logic of the speech rested on several key pillars that stand in stark contrast to the Beatific framework.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Canonization of the "Martyr":</strong> Trump framed Kirk's death in sacred terms, calling him the "greatest evangelist for American liberty" who has now become "immortal".<a href="#bib-12" class="bib-link">[12]</a> He declared, "He's a martyr now for America's freedom".<a href="#bib-12" class="bib-link">[12]</a><a href="#bib-13" class="bib-link">[13]</a> This language elevates a political activist to the status of a religious figure who died for a holy cause, transforming political struggle into a spiritual battle.</li>
        <li><strong>Explicit Rejection of Mercy:</strong> In a stunning moment, Trump directly contradicted the message of forgiveness offered just moments earlier by Kirk's widow, Erika. While she stated, "The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the Gospel is love," <a href="#bib-12" class="bib-link">[12]</a> Trump offered a different gospel. After praising Kirk for not hating his opponents, Trump confessed to the crowd, "I hate my opponents and I don't want the best for them. I'm sorry".<a href="#bib-11" class="bib-link">[11]</a> This was an open and unapologetic repudiation of the Beatific virtue of mercy.</li>
        <li><strong>A Litany of Grievance and Blame:</strong> The speech quickly pivoted from tribute to a campaign-style rally, attacking the "radical left" and blaming "networks of radical left maniacs" for Kirk's murder, without evidence.<a href="#bib-11" class="bib-link">[11]</a> This approach is a hallmark of <a href="#glossary-grievance-politics" class="glossary-link">grievance politics</a>, which thrives on identifying an "other" to hold responsible for problems and energizes supporters through shared resentment and anger.<a href="#bib-14" class="bib-link">[14]</a></li>
        <li><strong>The Kingdom of a Restored Past:</strong> The ultimate good, the "kingdom" being sought, is not a new spiritual reality based on inverted values, but the restoration of a perceived past national greatness. The vision is fundamentally nostalgic and restorative, seeking to "defend the country he lived for" <a href="#bib-15" class="bib-link">[15]</a> and "make America great again" <a href="#bib-16" class="bib-link">[16]</a>, a goal achieved through worldly strength and political domination.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IV. A Comparative Analysis: Beatific Vision vs. Political Eulogy</h2>
    <p>The juxtaposition of the eulogy's ethos with the normative framework of the Beatitudes reveals not a simple disagreement on values, but a systematic inversion of the entire ethical structure, punctuated by an explicit rejection of its core tenets.</p>

    <h3>A. The Inversion of Humility, Meekness, and Peacemaking</h3>
    <p>The eulogy's praise for Kirk as a "great American hero" <a href="#bib-13" class="bib-link">[13]</a> and "warrior for Christ" <a href="#bib-11" class="bib-link">[11]</a> stands as a direct antithesis to the blessing on the "poor in spirit." Where the Beatitude demands a recognition of absolute dependence on God, the eulogy celebrates worldly efficacy and confrontational strength. The blessing on the "meek"—those who channel their strength into humble service—is inverted into a blessing on the aggressive. The virtue is not controlling one's strength but demonstrating it. The blessing on "peacemakers" is likewise turned on its head. The eulogy praises not those who calm stormy spirits, but those who, in the words of another speaker at the event, Stephen Miller, awaken a dragon of determination: “You have no idea the dragon you have awakened, you have no idea how determined we will be to save this civilization, to save the West, to save this republic.”<a href="#bib-13" class="bib-link">[13]</a></p>

    <h3>B. The Explicit Rejection of Mercy and Mourning</h3>
    <p>The most direct and revealing clash with the Beatitudes came with Trump's open embrace of hatred. The Beatitude "Blessed are the merciful" <a href="#bib-1" class="bib-link">[1]</a> is not merely absent from the eulogy's moral universe; it is explicitly rejected. Trump's statement, "I hate my opponents and I don't want the best for them," <a href="#bib-11" class="bib-link">[11]</a> delivered in the solemn context of a memorial service, represents a conscious choice to replace the Christian ethic of love for one's enemy <a href="#bib-17" class="bib-link">[17]</a> with an ethic of political animosity. This was made all the more stark by its direct contradiction of Erika Kirk's message of Christian forgiveness.<a href="#bib-11" class="bib-link">[11]</a><a href="#bib-12" class="bib-link">[12]</a> Likewise, the eulogy offers no "mourning" over the societal brokenness that leads to political violence. Instead, it offers anger and grievance directed outward at a list of enemies—the "radical left maniacs"—held solely responsible.<a href="#bib-11" class="bib-link">[11]</a> These are not accidental omissions; they are structurally necessary because mercy and empathetic mourning are fundamentally incompatible with the eulogy's core ethos of strength, grievance, and conflict.</p>

    <h3>C. The Co-option of "Righteousness" and "Persecution"</h3>
    <p>The eulogy's most nuanced rhetorical move is its co-option of the language of righteousness and persecution. It appropriates the moral weight of these theological terms but hollows them out and refills them with purely political content. The "righteousness" for which Kirk is praised and was martyred is not the Beatific righteousness of mercy, purity of heart, and peacemaking. Instead, it is a righteousness defined by partisan allegiance and effectiveness in the "culture wars".<a href="#bib-11" class="bib-link">[11]</a> Using the diagnostic tool inherent in Matthew 5:10, the analysis becomes clear. The persecution is not the result of showing mercy to enemies or turning the other cheek; it is framed as the result of political combat, with blame assigned to a political out-group.<a href="#bib-11" class="bib-link">[11]</a> The eulogy performs a powerful semantic shift, replacing a theological category (suffering for adherence to God's counter-cultural ethics) with a political one (suffering for adherence to a political tribe) while retaining the language of martyrdom and divine favor.<a href="#bib-12" class="bib-link">[12]</a><a href="#bib-13" class="bib-link">[13]</a></p>

    <h2>V. Theological and Political Implications: Forging an American Beatitude</h2>
    <p>The analysis reveals more than just a political speech at odds with a religious text. It exposes the construction of an alternative, rival political theology with its own set of blessings designed to sanctify a particular political identity.</p>

    <h3>A. The Architecture of a Political Theology</h3>
    <p>The eulogy functions as a liturgical act, articulating a new "beatitude" for a specific political movement. This inverted beatitude can be summarized as follows: <em>Blessed are the strong, for they shall seize the earth. Blessed are those who hate their opponents, for they are righteous. Blessed are you when the radical left persecutes you and kills you for my sake, for you are a martyr for America.</em> This represents a deliberate and systematic inversion of the original text's meaning. It is not an accidental misinterpretation but a purposeful reconstruction designed to provide theological justification and moral sanction for a political identity rooted in aggression, grievance, and power.</p>

    <h3>B. Audience and Identity Formation</h3>
    <p>This rhetorical inversion serves a powerful function for its intended audience. It reassures a specific political base that their aggression is righteous "strength," their anger is a "hunger for justice," and the political consequences of their actions are holy "persecution." It is a potent tool of community formation, transforming a set of political attitudes into a moral and spiritual framework. By declaring hatred for a shared enemy in a sacred setting, the speaker validates the audience's own feelings of animosity, strengthening <a href="#glossary-ingroup" class="glossary-link">in-group</a> cohesion and deepening <a href="#glossary-ingroup" class="glossary-link">out-group</a> hostility.<a href="#bib-18" class="bib-link">[18]</a><a href="#bib-19" class="bib-link">[19]</a> This process sanctifies their political project, making it feel not merely expedient but divinely ordained. It allows adherents to see themselves as the faithful remnant, persecuted for their righteousness, rather than as political actors facing opposition.</p>

    <h3>C. Conclusion: Two Kingdoms, Two Visions</h3>
    <p>Ultimately, the analysis highlights the profound and growing divergence between the "Kingdom of Heaven" as envisioned in the Sermon on the Mount and the "kingdom" being forged and celebrated in this strain of American political rhetoric. The Beatitudes are fundamentally <a href="#glossary-eschatological" class="glossary-link">eschatological</a>, promising a future, divinely-wrought "reversal of fortunes" for the poor, the mourning, and the oppressed of the world.<a href="#bib-4" class="bib-link">[4]</a> Their hope is in a new order to come. In stark contrast, the eulogy's vision is restorative, promising a <em>restoration of fortune</em> for a group that perceives itself as a displaced cultural and political elite. Its hope is in a return to a perceived past greatness, achieved through worldly strength and political domination. The clash between these two "kingdoms"—one entered through spiritual poverty and mercy, the other seized by strength and hate—was laid bare on the memorial stage. The message of Christian forgiveness was offered, and then immediately rejected in favor of a message of political hatred, revealing which of the two visions holds ultimate power for this movement.</p>

            <dt id="glossary-authoritarian">Authoritarian Personality</dt>
            <dd>A personality type characterized by a collection of traits that increase susceptibility to authoritarian leaders. These traits include a strong preference for authority figures, rigid adherence to conventional values, aggression toward those who violate norms (out-groups), and a tendency to view the world as a dangerous and threatening place.</dd>

            <dt id="glossary-beatitudes">Beatitudes</dt>
            <dd>A series of blessings recounted by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:3–12). Each Beatitude names a group of people typically considered unfortunate (e.g., the poor in spirit, the meek) and pronounces them blessed, outlining the values and character of those belonging to the Kingdom of Heaven.</dd>
            
            <dt id="glossary-christian-nationalism">Christian Nationalism</dt>
            <dd>A political ideology advocating for the integration of Christianity into national governance. Proponents often believe the nation was founded by and for Christians and that its laws and culture should reflect Christian values. It can range from cultural conservatism to more extreme forms of religious supremacy.</dd>

            <dt id="glossary-civil-religion">Civil Religion</dt>
            <dd>The implicit religious values of a nation, expressed through public rituals, symbols (like a national flag), and ceremonies on sacred days and at sacred places (such as monuments or battlefields). It provides a moral and spiritual foundation that helps unify the state by giving it sacred authority.</dd>
            
            <dt id="glossary-dikaiosyne">Dikaiosynē (Righteousness)</dt>
            <dd>A Greek term (δικαιοσύνη) that denotes right standing and behavior within a community, particularly in relation to God's covenant. It is not merely an abstract moral virtue but a relational status, signifying an alignment with God's cosmic justice and divine order.</dd>

            <dt id="glossary-eleemon">Eleēmōn (Mercy)</dt>
            <dd>A Greek term (Ἐλεήμων) that implies more than passive pity. It describes active compassion and concrete actions to alleviate the suffering of others, reflecting God's own dynamic mercy. It is a reciprocal virtue: those who show mercy will receive it.</dd>

            <dt id="glossary-eschatological">Eschatological</dt>
            <dd>From eschatology, the part of theology concerned with "the last things," such as the end of history, the resurrection of the dead, the Last Judgment, and the final destiny of humanity. It often involves the belief in a future, divinely-wrought new world order that will replace the current one.</dd>
            
            <dt id="glossary-grievance-politics">Grievance Politics</dt>
            <dd>A political style defined by the fueling and funneling of negative emotions such as anger, resentment, and a sense of injustice. It thrives on blame-based narratives that target specific groups (elites, immigrants, political opponents) and transforms politics from a space for problem-solving into an outlet for vindication and vengeance.</dd>

            <dt id="glossary-ingroup">In-group/Out-group Dynamics</dt>
            <dd>A fundamental concept in social psychology where individuals categorize themselves into a social group they identify with (the "in-group") and distinguish it from others (the "out-group"). This process often leads to in-group favoritism (preferential treatment for one's own group) and out-group animosity or derogation, which is a key driver of political polarization.</dd>

            <dt id="glossary-political-theology">Political Theology</dt>
            <dd>An area of study that explores the ways in which theological concepts and religious thought relate to politics, governance, and social order. It examines how religious beliefs can be secularized into key political concepts and how faith traditions provide frameworks for addressing political questions.</dd>

            <dt id="glossary-praos">Praos (Meekness)</dt>
            <dd>A Greek term (πραΰς) that does not mean weakness or timidity. Instead, it describes strength that is under control, gently tempered, and humbly channeled into service rather than used for selfish advantage or coercion.</dd>

            <dt id="glossary-ptochos">Ptochos to pneumati (Poor in spirit)</dt>
            <dd>A Greek phrase (πτωχοὶ τῷ πνεύματι) where "ptochos" signifies someone who is utterly destitute, a beggar. "Poor in spirit" thus describes a state of complete spiritual bankruptcy and absolute dependence on God, a recognition that one has nothing and is nothing apart from God's grace.</dd>
